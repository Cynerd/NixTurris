Subject: [PATCH 58/90] ARM: dts: armada-370: Fix assigned-addresses for every
 PCIe Root Port
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

BDF of resource in DT assigned-addresses property of Marvell PCIe Root Port
(PCI-to-PCI bridge) should match BDF in address part in that DT node name
as specified resource belongs to Marvell PCIe Root Port itself.

Fixes: a09a0b7c6ff1 ("arm: mvebu: add PCIe Device Tree informations for Armada 370")
