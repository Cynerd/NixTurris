Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Implement workaround for PCIe Completion
 Timeout
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Marvell Armada 3700 Functional Errata, Guidelines, and Restrictions
document describes in erratum 3.12 PCIe Completion Timeout (Ref #: 251),
that PCIe IP does not support a strong-ordered model for inbound posted vs.
outbound completion.

As a workaround for this erratum, DIS_ORD_CHK flag in Debug Mux Control
register must be set. It disables the ordering check in the core between
Completions and Posted requests received from the link.

Marvell also suggests to do full memory barrier at the beginning of
aardvark summary interrupt handler before calling interrupt handlers of
endpoint drivers in order to minimize the risk for the race condition
documented in the Erratum between the DMA done status reading and the
completion of writing to the host memory.

More details about this issue and suggested workarounds are in discussion:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/BN9PR18MB425154FE5019DCAF2028A1D5DB8D9@BN9PR18MB4251.namprd18.prod.outlook.com/t/#u

It was reported that enabling this workaround fixes instability issues and
"Unhandled fault" errors when using 60 GHz WiFi 802.11ad card with Qualcomm
QCA6335 chip under significant load which were caused by interrupt status
stuck in the outbound CMPLT queue traced back to this erratum.

This workaround fixes also kernel panic triggered after some minutes of
usage 5 GHz WiFi 802.11ax card with Mediatek MT7915 chip:

    Internal error: synchronous external abort: 96000210 [#1] SMP
    Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
